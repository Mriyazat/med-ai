University of Guelph - College of Engineering Professor Dr. Eranga Ukwatta and team, including graduate student Nicola Billings and researchers in Ontario Veterinary College, University of Guelph, are using artificial intelligence to improve radiation treatment planning for dogs with cancer.

The team is using neural networks to generate realistic, pseudo-CT images from MRI image data. If AI-generated CT images can match the diagnostic accuracy of real CT scans, veterinarians could use MRI data to create CT-like images without costly testing or exposing animals to unnecessary radiation and sedation.

  <p>"Future studies should focus on optimizing the models for different dog breeds, validating evaluation scales, and exploring methods to reduce errors for improved clinical applicability in radiation therapy planning," says Ukwatta.</p>
