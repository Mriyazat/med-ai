    bio: "Zachary obtained his undergraduate degree at the **University of Guelph** in **Biomedical Engineering**. He completed his **MASc** at the **University of Guelph** in 2021 and continued into his **PhD**. He was always interested in **image analysis and signal processing** throughout his undergraduate degree and pursued that interest in his graduate work. Zachary's research currently revolves around **identifying organs and regions of interest from ultrasound images**. In his **MASc**, he investigated **neonatal intracranial hemorrhage**. His project involved developing deep learning models to identify the cerebral ventricles of neonates and evaluate whether hemorrhaging is present. He continued this work into his **PhD** by developing leaner and more accurate models using semi-supervised learning. He then partnered with [**Cosm Medical**](https://www.cosm.care/) to help build models that identify **female pelvic floor anatomical structures** and make measurements to help evaluate **pelvic floor prolapse**. Zachary's final **PhD** project included work with [**Oncoustics**](https://www.oncoustics.com/) (Toronto) to identify **fatty liver disease in point-of-care ultrasound images**. The team not only segmented liver tissue but also used those segmentations to determine image quality."

    bio: "Mohammadreza is an incoming **PhD student** in **Biomedical Engineering** at the **University of Guelph** (starting Fall 2025). He holds an **MASc** in **Systems and Computing** from the **University of Guelph** and an **MSc** in **Electrical Engineering (Control Engineering)** from **Khajeh Nasir Toosi University of Technology** in Iran, along with a **BSc** in **Electrical Engineering (Electronics)**. With an interdisciplinary foundation spanning **control systems, computing, electronics**, and **medical AI**—and a strong, advanced background in **mathematics, statistics**, and **machine learning/deep learning**—his work bridges classical systems theory with state-of-the-art computational approaches in medical imaging. During his master's studies, Mohammadreza conducted research in **medical image segmentation** with a focus on **deep learning, privacy-preserving AI**, and **clinical robustness**. His work included developing a **3D TransUNet-based model** for **multi-modal brain tumor segmentation**—featuring advanced preprocessing, registration-based augmentation, hybrid loss functions, and multi-GPU optimization—which achieved strong performance on the **BraTS benchmark**. He also built end-to-end centralized, federated, adversarial, and differentially private learning pipelines for **MRI brain segmentation** using **PyTorch, Flower, MONAI**, and **Opacus**. At the **University of Guelph**, Mohammadreza serves as the **College of Engineering Steward** for [**CUPE 3913**](https://cupe3913.on.ca/), representing graduate teaching personnel and supporting members through communications, orientation leadership, and event organization. He also serves as the **International Affairs Officer** for the **Graduate Engineering Student Society (GESS)**, following his previous role as **Vice President (External)** for the same organization. Additionally, he works as an **AI Developer** for the [**College of Computational, Mathematical, and Physical Sciences**](https://www.uoguelph.ca/ccmps/), where he developed a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot** that delivers instant, accurate academic support and transforms complex AI technologies into practical educational tools."
    current_project: "Mohammadreza's **PhD research** focuses on a major challenge in **veterinary neuroimaging**: automatically detecting and segmenting **susceptibility artifacts** caused by **RFID microchip implants** in small animals. These microchips often generate severe **signal voids, hyperintense rims**, and **geometric distortions** that can make **spinal MRI non-diagnostic**—especially in the **cervical and thoracic regions**. In small-breed dogs, when the **microchip-to-spinal canal distance** is less than **19 mm**, evaluation of the **spinal cord** becomes nearly impossible, leaving clinicians with limited diagnostic options. To address this, he is developing a **self-supervised, label-efficient deep learning framework** capable of detecting and segmenting these artifact regions directly from routine **MRI scans** without requiring large annotated datasets. This work represents the first **veterinary-specific, label-efficient system** for automated **metal artifact detection and segmentation**, with applications spanning **MRI triage, protocol optimization, workflow efficiency**, and future **artifact-correction pipelines**. The framework is designed to generalize across **scanners, field strengths**, and standard **veterinary imaging protocols**, ultimately improving **diagnostic confidence** in small animal medicine."
