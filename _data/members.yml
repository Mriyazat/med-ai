    bio: "Zachary obtained his undergraduate degree at the **University of Guelph** in **Biomedical Engineering**. He completed his **MASc** at the **University of Guelph** in 2021 and continued into his **PhD**. He was always interested in **image analysis and signal processing** throughout his undergraduate degree and pursued that interest in his graduate work. Zachary's research currently revolves around **identifying organs and regions of interest from ultrasound images**. In his **MASc**, he investigated **neonatal intracranial hemorrhage**. His project involved developing deep learning models to identify the cerebral ventricles of neonates and evaluate whether hemorrhaging is present. He continued this work into his **PhD** by developing leaner and more accurate models using semi-supervised learning. He then partnered with [**Cosm Medical**](https://www.cosm.care/) to help build models that identify **female pelvic floor anatomical structures** and make measurements to help evaluate **pelvic floor prolapse**. Zachary's final **PhD** project included work with [**Oncoustics**](https://www.oncoustics.com/) (Toronto) to identify **fatty liver disease in point-of-care ultrasound images**. The team not only segmented liver tissue but also used those segmentations to determine image quality."

  - name: "Zinah Ghulam"
    position: "MASc Candidate"
    degree: "MASc"
    image: "/images/members/zinah_ghulam.png"
    bio: "Zinah Ghulam is a **MASc candidate** in **Computer Engineering** at the **University of Guelph**, specializing in **AI-driven medical imaging**. She is also pursuing the **Collaborative Specialization in Artificial Intelligence (CSAI)** through the [**Vector Institute**](https://vectorinstitute.ai/). Her work lies at the intersection of **artificial intelligence, radiology**, and **clinical decision support**, with a focus on developing **multimodal deep learning systems** that can interpret both medical images and text-based reports. She is passionate about designing AI models that align with clinical reasoning and improve diagnostic efficiency. Zinah is particularly interested in **interpretable machine learning, multimodal fusion**, and **medical imaging applications** that enhance disease understanding and reporting. Beyond her research, Zinah serves as the **President of the Graduate Engineering Student Society (GESS)** for the year **2025**, where she leads initiatives to strengthen community engagement and professional development among graduate students in the **College of Engineering**. She also serves as **Co-Chair of the Student Committee** for the [**Imaging Network Ontario (ImNO) 2026**](https://www.imno.ca/) conference, helping foster collaboration and knowledge exchange among emerging researchers in medical imaging and healthcare innovation. Outside of academics, she enjoys staying active through walks and runs, baking, volunteering, learning new languages, photography, and exploring local cafés — pursuits that help her maintain a thoughtful balance between leadership, research, and creativity."

    orcid: "https://orcid.org/0009-0000-6088-0669"
    current_project: "Zinah's primary research focuses on **Multimodal Deep Learning for Severity Assessment in Chest X-Rays Using Radiology Reports**. Her work explores how visual and textual information can be jointly modeled to better assess disease severity and improve automated report generation. She is developing a **Multimodal Triage Network (MTN)** — a deep learning framework that integrates chest X-ray images and corresponding radiology reports to produce **diagnostic captions** and **continuous severity scores**. By aligning visual features with clinical language representations, the model aims to provide a more comprehensive and clinically grounded understanding of disease progression. In parallel, Zinah is also contributing to a **smart diabetic sock system** for **foot ulcer prevention**, where she is developing a **thermal model** to optimize **sensor placement** and improve early detection of ulcer formation. This work combines **biomedical engineering, data modeling**, and **clinical insight** to address a critical challenge in diabetic care. Together, her research advances the field of **vision-language modeling** and **sensor-based diagnostics** in medical AI, contributing to safer, more transparent, and patient-centered healthcare technologies."

  - name: "Aishwarya Ramesh"
    position: "MASc Student"
    degree: "MASc"
    image: "/images/members/aishwarya_ramesh.jpg"
    bio: "**Aishwarya** is a **Master of Applied Science** student in **Biomedical Engineering** starting in Fall 2025. She recently completed her undergraduate degree in **Biomedical Engineering** at the **University of Guelph** as well. Her research interests focus on applying **AI** to develop and improve resources in medical diagnoses. Her current work involves working collaboratively with the **Ontario Veterinary Collage (OVC)** to develop a generative **AI** tool that assists veterinary radiologists in generating complete radiology reports. In the future she hopes to apply **AI** and medical imaging technologies to real-world clinical and industry settings."
    current_project: "There is an increasing demand for radiologists in veterinary medicine that can diagnose and write treatment reports. Currently, without enough radiologists there are delays and more stress placed on the systems being used. To address the shortage of veterinary radiologists, this project aims to develop and validate a veterinary specific generative **AI** model that can create high-quality radiology reports from the medical findings. Using anonymized reports provided by the **Ontario Veterinary Collage (OVC)** there will be a set of training and validation reports used to train various language models. The generated reports will be edited by a radiologist and used to retrain the models, then the reports will be compared in performance using established language model metrics, using radiologist written reports as a golden standard. New reports will be entered into the models and an expert radiologist will then be asked to compare the final **AI** generated reports to radiologist written reports in term of quality and clinical relevance."

  - name: "Pramit Dutta"
    position: "MASc Student"
    degree: "MASc"

    bio: "**Pramit** is a Graduate Research Assistant at the **Medical Artificial Intelligence Lab** at the **University of Guelph**, where he is completing his **MASc** in **Computer Engineering** with a **Specialization in Artificial Intelligence**. He earned his **B.Sc.** in **Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering** from the **Chittagong University of Engineering and Technology**. His research interests center on multimodal and generative **AI**, with experience spanning hybrid feature extraction and self-supervised learning frameworks in medical imaging. Much of his work bridges the gap between algorithmic design and real-world clinical data, with the aim of developing systems that can assist in decision-making while minimizing reliance on labeled data. His research focuses on developing **vision-language models (VLMs)** for medical imaging. He explores how large pretrained models can be adapted to clinical data to improve interpretability and domain robustness, particularly through better domain adaptation techniques that bridge the gap between general and medical datasets. He works on integrating visual features from **CT scans** with language-based clinical information to enhance diagnostic insight and support clinical decision-making. Looking ahead, he aims to extend these multimodal learning approaches to other fields including veterinary imaging to advance scalable, cross-domain applications of **AI** in healthcare."
